# yellowbench

Solana RPC benchmarking tool for [Yellowstone Dragon's Mouth Geyser](https://github.com/rpcpool/yellowstone-grpc)

This is a simple CLI tool that allows you to receive updates from a geyser server and measure their latency. The goal of this tool is to measure the latency and throughput of the geyser server.

> [!TIP]
> Looking to measure transaction landing times instead ? Check out [memobench](https://github.com/benjiewheeler/memobench)

## Usage

- Download the latest release for your OS and architecture from [the releases page](https://github.com/benjiewheeler/yellowbench/releases).
- Execute the binary in a command prompt or terminal.
  - Upon first execution it will create a sample `config.json` file and exit
  - Edit the `config.json` file as needed
- Execute the binary again to start the benchmark

### Configuration

- `geyser_url`: The Geyser endpoint to benchmark
- `geyser_token`: The `x-token` authentication string _(optional, keep empty if not required)_
- `send_rpc_url`: The RPC endpoint to send transactions _(optional, if omitted, the RPC URL will be used)_
- `bench_type`: The type of the test to perform, `latency` to test the latency of the blocks received against the local clock, `throughput` to test the throughput of the data received
- `duration_sec`: The duration of the test in seconds
